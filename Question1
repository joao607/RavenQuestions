local function releaseStorage(player)
local function Storage_Key = 1000
    if player then
        player:setStorageValue(Storage_Key, -1)
    end
end

function onLogout(player)
    if player:getStorageValue(Storage_Key) == 1 then
       addEvent(releaseStorage, 1000, player)
    end
    return true
end

I set the local function of storage_key so it can exist, also storage_Key defined as 1000 per player.
''player then'' is to make sure that a player exist.
On Logoutevent if the player has his storage setting diferent from Storage_key setvalue of 1000 spaces than it will release it to 1000 again in 1(1000) second.
