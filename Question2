function printSmallGuildNames(MemberCount)
    if type(MemberCount) "Number" or MemberCount <= 0 then
	print ("Invalid Number of Members")  
    	return true
end
	Local query = string.format("SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE max_members < %d;", memberCount)
    	Local resultId = db.storeQuery(query)
	
    if resultId then
        repeat
            local GuildName = resultId:getString("name")
            print(GuildName)
        until not resultId:next(resultID)
            result:free(resultId)      
        end
    else
        print("No Guild Found with less than ("10") Members.")
end

If the MemberCount is lower than 0 it will print error for invalid quantity of Members. Return true to affirm  print over negative counting members. 
local resultId on db(data base) is to ensure that after checking the id on data base if returned wrong means that your research is not valid.
Result.free is just to refresh the cash memory of the resultID after showing the result
the last print is to show that there is no guild with less than 10 Members
